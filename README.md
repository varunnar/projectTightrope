# projectTightrope
Tightrope is a narrative-driven, multiplayer interactive experience about the physical and mental experiences of anxiety, and how we can support those around us who may be going through a tough time.


# How to play
Tightrope is played with a number of physical controllers. Player 1 stands on a balancing board, and holds a balancing rod with an attached CPX. As they lean to the left and right the can collect/avoid positive and negative emotion orbs.

Player 2/3 wear large wing controllers they can move orbs in and out of player 1's path, attempting to help them. As the team collects more negative orbs the background grows brighter, while if they collect more negative it grows darker. Once they fully illuminate the screen the game is completed.
